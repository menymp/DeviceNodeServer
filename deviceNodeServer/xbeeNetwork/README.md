This server will act as an addapter for an xbee star network where the following information will be managed

- active devices
- specific states and configurations of active devices
- interface to send commands to active devices

the idea is also that a single server acts as a control endpoint, however multiple networks can be created by
adding multiple instances of the following server with its asociated xbee serial device.
ToDo: Write detailed documentation
